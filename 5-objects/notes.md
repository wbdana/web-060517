Instructions:
  Car.new
  Car.new

  Write a method called count, that will return to me the number of cars that have been created.

1. What do we know about objects?
  - How do we use them
  - What is an object
  - What are they good for
2. Why do we even need objects?
  - Why not just use a hash?
3. Object mechanics
  I. Object instances
  - instance methods
  - instance variables
  - scope
  - object lifecycle
  II. Class methods and class variables
    - why have them
    - how they work
    - scope
  III. self-referencing with objects
