Problem Solving techniques
  Think about the data structure that I want to solve this problem
  Reducing the amount of information
  How many points someone has scored

  something like a roster, but maybe not divided by teams
  {"Kevin Durant" => {name: "Kevin Durant", points: 33, minutes_played: 24}}
  [{name: "kevin durant"} {name: "lebron james", points: 33}]

  1. Give me a list of players, with each players stats
    [{player_name: '', points: , shoe_size: }]
  2. Find the player
  3. find the player's points

Coding
  DRY - don't repeat yourself
  def say_greeting(greeting)
     puts greeting + 'my name is Jeff'
  end

  [1, 2, 3]
  say_greeting('hi')
  say_greeting('hola')

  looking for the points
  Get each player has their points
  {bob: 34}

  Then can find
